# steering — how this extension's decisions and sessions are recorded

Two folders and two rules.

**`design/`** — one file per decision, numbered `100`–`199`. A note states
**today's state**: the decision in force, the defects not yet resolved, the
open questions. Not the history — that is in `git log` and in `steps/`.

Header, normed, because the scripts read it:

    # NNN — Title

    **Date** : YYYY-MM-DD · **Statut** : <status> — <nuance>

The date is that of the **last update**. The status comes from a closed
vocabulary, least to most settled:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ébauche` | written; the decision is not made |
| `à trancher` | the question is posed, the answer is missing |
| `chantier ouvert` | decided; the work remains |
| `constats établis` | an observation note: it reports, it does not decide |
| `acté` | decided; no code to write, or not yet |
| `tranché` | settled on the merits |
| `implémenté` | decided and carried out in the code |

A change is made **in place**, as if the note had always said so. No
`Révision du …` section, no account of a request and how it was handled, no
discarded option kept for the record, no corrected defect — a pointer to the
commit that fixes it, or nothing. `coherence.py` refuses a note that carries
a revision section.

Every note appears exactly once in [design/README.md](design/README.md),
with the same status it states itself.

**`steps/`** — the journal, one file per session
(`YYYY-MM-DD-session-N.md`): what was done, what was learned, the exact state
at the stop, and **the next concrete action**. Unlike a note, a journal entry
is dated and **never rewritten**. Parallel sessions: sort the existing names
before creating yours, never overwrite someone else's.

## The two scripts

    python3 steering/bin/coherence.py     # must exit 0 before any commit
    python3 steering/bin/ouvert.py        # everything still open

`coherence.py` catches notes and index that contradict each other, numbers
taken twice, statuses outside the vocabulary, and dead links. `ouvert.py`
gathers what remains: open statuses, inline markers, the journal's next
action, and — `--what maxime` — what Maxime wrote since an agent last passed.

## Language

The notes and the journal stay in **French**: internal reasoning, not the
product. Everything else a third party reads — this file, the scripts, the
code, the documentation — is in **English**.

## Where the rest lives

These notes were kept until 2026-09-11 in a private steering repository
shared by the nine repositories of the workspace, and moved here so that the
decisions travel with the code they decide. Two things stayed there, on
purpose: the journal from before that date, which interleaves this extension
with the other projects and cannot be split without rewriting dated
documents; and the cross-project TODO, which is what such a repository is
for.

Note 101 describes the language server, whose **code lives in the `ldpy`
repository** (`ldpy/lsp/`), not here. It travels with the eight others all
the same: it is the architecture they depend on, 102 and 107 cite it, and
splitting the nine would break the run of numbers that the other
repositories use to refer to them.

Notes belonging to other projects are referenced by number, without a link.
ldpy's own notes are public, in `ldpy/steering/design/`; those of the corpus
study, the article and the rest are not.
