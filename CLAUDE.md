# Instructions for Claude — vscode-ldpy

## What this is

The VS Code extension for `ldpy`, an extension of Python that brings Turtle
notation into the language's syntax. Two things matter about how it is built:

- **the TextMate grammar under `syntaxes/` is generated, never edited by
  hand** — `npm run generate` derives it from MagicPython, and `npm test`
  checks parity with pure Python. A hand edit survives until the next
  generation and no longer;
- **the language server is not in this repository.** It lives in `ldpy`
  (`ldpy/lsp/`), a thin request-forwarding server; the extension is its
  client. Design note 101 describes it and travels with this repository all
  the same.

## Before changing anything

**Read what Maxime wrote since an agent last passed, and deal with it:**

```sh
python3 steering/bin/ouvert.py --what maxime
```

It shows the uncommitted changes under `steering/` — an agent always commits,
so whatever is loose came from him — and the commits carrying no `Claude`
co-author. What he adds to a design note is an **instruction**: answer it in
the note itself, and say so in the journal. Never build on top without having
read them.

## Picking work back up

1. `steering/steps/` — the **most recent** file: state at the stop, and the
   next action.
2. `python3 steering/bin/ouvert.py` — everything still open, gathered.
3. `steering/design/README.md` — the decisions in force.
4. `git status && git log --oneline -5`.
5. `npm ci && npm test` — parity of the generated grammar, the declared
   contributions, and the user journeys. `npm run lint` type-checks without
   emitting.

## Keeping the records (mandatory, every session)

`steering/` holds the decisions and the journal — its
[README](steering/README.md) states the header format, the closed status
vocabulary and the two rules that matter:

- a **design note states today's state**, and is changed **in place**, as if
  it had always said so — no `Révision du …` section, no discarded option
  kept for the record, no corrected defect;
- a **journal entry is dated and never rewritten**.

`python3 steering/bin/coherence.py` must exit 0 before any commit that
touches `steering/`. Any non-trivial choice gets a design note, before or
just after the implementation.

Design notes of the other repositories are referenced **by number, never by
link**: `ldpy/024` is public in `ldpy/steering/design/`, `corpus/402` is in
the private steering repository.

## Language

**Everything a third party can read is in English**: code (comments, test
names, error messages), documentation, configuration, the strings VS Code
shows the user — command titles, setting descriptions, notifications. **The
design notes and the journal stay in French** — internal reasoning, not the
product — and so do commit messages, for now.

## Working rules

- Every feature arrives **with its tests**; the suite stays green at each
  commit. `test/parity.js` is the one that catches a grammar edited by hand.
- A contribution declared in `package.json` and not implemented — or the
  reverse — is what `test/contributes.js` exists to refuse.
- Atomic commits, in French, signed
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## What does not push itself

This repository is public on GitHub (`origin`) and a `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers
publication to the Visual Studio Marketplace and to Open VSX — so a tag is a
deliberate act, never a step in a routine. `npm version minor` bumps
`package.json` and creates the tag; the release notes go in `CHANGELOG.md`
first.
